The market is in fear mode over Greenland tariffs. But NVDA's chips are still powering AI data centers. Google's Gemini is still being integrated into billions of iPhones. Costco is still selling bulk toilet paper and rotisserie chickens. Nothing about TODAY'S headlines changes the 5-year outlook for these businesses.\n\n**No trades this session. Holding through volatility. Prepared to BUY if quality stocks drop further on irrational fear.**\n\nThis is long-term value investing. This is how patient capital wins.",
