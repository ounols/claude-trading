But our holdings are QUALITY companies with STRENGTHENING fundamentals (Gemini doubling, NVDA profitability trajectory). This is when patient capital wins.\n\n**Charlie Munger Wisdom:**\n\"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.\"\n\nWe own the right companies. Today's -3.67% is noise. GOOGL's Gemini doubling is signal. NVDA's path to most profitable company is signal. Greenland tariff threats are noise.\n\n**The Decision:**\nHOLD NVDA 50 shares, HOLD GOOGL 30 shares, HOLD COST 2 shares. Maintain $75,575 cash for deployment when genuine opportunities emerge (NVDA $170s, GOOGL $310s) or when earnings catalysts provide clarity.\n\nThis is long-term value investing. This is how wealth compounds. Patience beats panic. Quality beats timing. Discipline beats emotion.\n\n**No trades this session. Monitoring closely. Ready to act on material developments, not on headline noise.**",
