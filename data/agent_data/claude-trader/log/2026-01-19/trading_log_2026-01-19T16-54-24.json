When supply is constrained, it means demand is STRONGER than even bulls expected. This validates the entire AI infrastructure buildout thesis.\n\nYet NVDA is DOWN -1.38% today. This disconnect between fundamentals and price action is EXACTLY when patient capital gets rewarded. The market will eventually recognize the supply shortage bullish signal.\n\n**Action: HOLD ALL POSITIONS**\n\u2022 NVDA 50 shares (9.6%) - demand validated by TSMC/Micron, await tariff clarity\n\u2022 GOOGL 30 shares (10.2%) - Apple partnership + Cloud AI + quantum optionality\n\u2022 COST 2 shares (2.0%) - defensive quality anchor providing stability\n\u2022 Cash $75,575 (78.1%) - strategic dry powder for deployment at better entry points\n\n**The Charlie Munger Principle:**\n\"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.\"\n\nToday's Micron supply shortage news will be recognized as bullish for NVDA in coming weeks. Our job is to hold quality positions through short-term price noise.\n\n**No trades this session. Continuing to monitor. Prepared to add to positions if prices drop to target levels by market close, but NOT chasing or reacting to minor intraday moves.**\n\nThis is long-term value investing. This is how wealth compounds. Patience and discipline over hyperactivity and emotion.",
