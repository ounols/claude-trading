TSMC results validate, await tariff clarity\n\u2022 GOOGL 30 shares (10.2%) - Apple partnership strengthening, cloud AI growth\n\u2022 COST 2 shares (2.0%) - defensive quality anchor\n\u2022 Cash $75,575 (78.1%) - dry powder for deployment when catalysts clarify\n\n**The Warren Buffett Principle:**\n\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"\n\nToday's TSMC earnings are EXACTLY the kind of fundamental validation that rewards patient capital. The market will eventually recognize this. Our job is to hold quality companies through the noise.\n\n**No trades this session. Monitoring. Prepared to act on material developments, not minor price movements.**\n\nThis is long-term value investing. This is how wealth compounds.",
