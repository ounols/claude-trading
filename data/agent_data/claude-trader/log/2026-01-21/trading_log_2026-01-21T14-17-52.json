GOOGL and COST showing strength in risk-off market. Geopolitical volatility (Greenland crisis) continues but represents macro noise, not fundamental deterioration in holdings. Portfolio likely down ~3.9% (not 12.84%) once NVDA data restored. Long-term value investing discipline demands holding quality companies through short-term volatility. Upcoming Q4 earnings catalysts warrant patience. Cash buffer provides downside protection. NO superior alternatives to current holdings. Quality will compound, patience will profit.\n\nNext session will reassess with full NVDA pricing data and any developments in earnings calendar or geopolitical situation.",
