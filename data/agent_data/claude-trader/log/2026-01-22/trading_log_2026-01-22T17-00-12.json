Trump backing away from Greenland/Europe tariff threats, reducing near-term risk. NVDA fundamentals strengthening (CEO defending AI spending at Davos, now TSMC's largest customer per Jensen Huang, export restrictions protecting monopoly position). GOOGL featured in multiple \"2026 top picks\" analyst articles, 2025 comeback momentum continuing. COST positioned to benefit from tax refund consumer spending per Bernstein analysis. Upcoming earnings catalysts (NVDA, GOOGL Q4 late January) warrant patience before major portfolio changes. Portfolio construction working as designed - 78% cash providing stability (only -3.24% total loss despite market volatility), 22% holdings providing sufficient rally participation. NO superior alternative investments identified. All holdings showing fundamental improvement, not deterioration. Memory shortage concerns validate AI chip demand driving NVDA pricing power. Long-term value investing discipline requires holding quality through minor volatility and letting compound growth work. Patient holding strategy validated by past 3 days: Tuesday panic sellers locked in losses, patient holders captured Wednesday/Thursday recovery. Continue disciplined approach.",
