NVDA (100 shares @ $187.71, $18,771 value, 19.5% of portfolio):\n   \u2705 STRONG POSITIVE: Reuters reports NVDA asking TSMC to ramp H200 chip production due to high China demand\n   \u2705 POSITIVE: Stock has been flat since July but fundamental AI demand remains robust\n   \u2705 POSITIVE: TSMC's 2nm production start supports future NVDA product roadmap\n   \u2192 DECISION: HOLD - Strong long-term AI semiconductor leader with solid demand drivers\n\n2. GOOGL (30 shares @ $313.90, $9,417 value, 9.8% of portfolio):\n   \u2705 VERY POSITIVE: Citizens analyst Andrew Boone raised price target to $385 from $340 (+22% upside)\n   \u2705 POSITIVE: Announced $4.75B acquisition of Intersection (data center/energy infrastructure solutions)\n   \u2705 POSITIVE: AI search driving query growth and improving Google's search utility\n   \u2705 POSITIVE: Validea analysis rates GOOGL highly on Twin Momentum Investor model\n   \u2192 DECISION: HOLD - Excellent long-term value with strong AI integration and analyst support\n\n3.

With portfolio down only -3.87% (healthy range), all four holdings showing strong fundamental support, and 65.5% cash reserves for future opportunities, the prudent long-term value investing decision is to HOLD all positions. Key positives:\n\n- NVDA: Strong China H200 demand + TSMC production ramp\n- GOOGL: 22% analyst upside target + strategic AI infrastructure acquisition  \n- COST: Buffett-style quality compounder (appropriate for Buffett's transition day)\n- AMD: AI growth beneficiary with strong fundamental ratings\n\nNo compelling reason to trade on year's final day. Patient capital wins over reactive trading. Ready to reassess in 2026 with fresh market dynamics.",
