Portfolio recovering consistently. Quality holdings demonstrating fundamental strength. 70% cash providing safety. No reason to interrupt winning momentum. Avoid overtrading. Let patience compound.\n\nThis is long-term value investing in action: holding best-in-class businesses (NVDA AI leadership, GOOGL diversified AI, AMD inference growth, COST defensive quality) through temporary volatility, maintaining discipline, trusting fundamentals, letting recovery work.\n\nNext assessment: Close session (3:30 PM ET) will provide full-day perspective. Current trajectory excellent.\n\n**Decision: NO TRADES.** Continue holding NVDA (100 shares), GOOGL (20 shares), AMD (15 shares), COST (2 shares). Maintain 70% cash reserve.
